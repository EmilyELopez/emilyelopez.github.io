I am a first year doctoral student at the [University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Mathematics PhD Program](https://cse.umn.edu/math). I am grateful to be supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests broadly lie in stochastic dynamics, and I hope to explore its utility in creating interpretable guarantees for machine learning algorithms.
 
 I first became fascinated in this area through my undergraduate research in modeling opinion dynamics and optimal transport while at the [University of California Santa Barbara College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). Currently, I am studying causal inference with network interference under the guidance of Cornell ORIE Professor [Christina Lee Yu](https://cleeyu.orie.cornell.edu/). 

 Outside of math, I enjoy baking, playing board games with friends, and have recently picked up yoga. If you ever want to chat, whether it be math related or a matter of exchanging cookie recipes, please reach out to my email [lope0646@umn.edu](lope0646@umn.edu).
