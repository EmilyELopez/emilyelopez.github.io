The EDGE Webinar Series showcases the contributions of women and nonbinary mathematicians. Every month or so, a graduate student invites an EDGE alumni to share their journey and speak more about their research or skills that have propelled their careers. It has been a blast to work with [Lucy Martinez](https://marti310.github.io/research.html), [Arielle Leitner](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~ariellel/), and Kathryn Van Etten to get this webinar series started. 

If you would like to host a webinar or recommend a speaker, please reach out to my email [lope0646@umn.edu](lope0646@umn.edu). This is a great way to meet a math researcher whom you admire their work!
