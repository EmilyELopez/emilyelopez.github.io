In many settings, such as electrical network monitoring and quantum systems, it is desired to optimize resources and time among connected objects in a network. This type of optimization motivates the throttling parameter, in which SMALL 2020 extended this parameter to directed graphs. In our work, we explored how graph operations impact the throttling number to give an interval of throttling values for specific graph families.
